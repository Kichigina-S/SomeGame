## Some Game for Test Project

This project was made for Heads and Hands school. <br>
Using this, you can make some duel between Monster and Player <br>
Monster is usually a bad character, so only Player can heal himself. (Sorry, Monster!) <br>

## How to use

After you run the project you'll see small window with buttons and labels. <br>
When the project starts, one player and one monster are created. <br>
You'll see information about thems in labels. <br> 
So, if you wanna make some kick - just push the button! <br>

In the lower right corner you can see what's going on, after pushing any of button. <br>

Also you can heal your Player. BUT! Only four times. <br>
So, if you wanna heal - just push the button! <br>

## The end

Yeah, that is the end.
