## Some Game for Test Project

This project was made for Heads and Hands school. <br>
Using this, you can make some Monster and Player, which could kick each other. <br>
Monster is usually a bad character, so only Player can heal himself. (Sorry, Monster!) <br>

## How to use

So, if you wanna make some kick, firstly you should make some Essence. <br>
Create your Player and use method setValuesToPlayer(), to fill our object with values. <br>
You can ask me: "Ahh, which values?" <br>
There is a class Essence, where 3(4) setters set special values of Attack, Protect, Healthy, Damage according to the task. <br>
Than create your Monster and use method setValuesToMonster(), to fill our object with values. <br><br>

If you wanna see information about created Essence just use method printInfo(Essence essence). <br><br>

Now you can kick! <br>
Use method kickEssence(Essence essenceDefensive, Essence essenceAttacking) as you can see, first param is Defensive essence and second param is Attacking essence.<br><br>

If kick was successful you would see some sting in terminal.<br>
Else you wouldn't.<br><br>

Also you can heal your Player. BUT! Only three times.<br>
So, if you wanna heal use method healPlayer(Player player).<br>

## The end

Yeah, that is the end.
